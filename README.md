# Qt-calculator
## Introduction
Welcome to the Qt-calculator project!</br>
As the name suggests, we build a calculator with variety of commonly used functions, interacted by GUI.</br>
We use the Qt creator IDE to setup the project, due to its excellent internal build tools, especially for GUI. </br>
The calculator can be used on all platforms(altough the GUI may differ on each platform).</br>



### requirements ✅
**Qt creator** or **Qmake** build system set up in your IDE

### Setting up Qt 💻
* Start by installing the Qt SDK from [qt.io](https://www.qt.io/download). Since the online installers can be pretty buggy, it was decided to go with the offline Open Source version
* The installer does not include any compiler on its default install. Make sure you select the fitting MinGW compiler.
* As mentioned above, Qt Creator is a sort of an IDE with internal build tools. So currently, it's a good idea to install this.
* We will not be using CMake since QMake comes bundled with the creator.
