### requirements ✅
**Qt creator** or **Qmake** build system set up in your IDE

### Setting up Qt 💻
* Start by installing the Qt SDK from [qt.io](https://www.qt.io/download). I decided to go with the Open Source version
* Qt Creator is a sort of an IDE with internal build tools. So currently, it's a good idea to install this.
* We will not be using CMake since QMake comes bundled with the creator
